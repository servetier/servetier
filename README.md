## Hello, world!
Just a college student trying to make my mark on the world.

### About Me
I am Servetier, or Ser (zee-er) for short. My pronouns are they/them. I'm a novice coder looking to start honing my skills.

I enjoy coding because I, too, require precise and detailed instructions where one slight mistake in wording will cause me to do everything entirely differently than expected, frustrating everyone around me.

### Projects
Currently Working On: [Awesome Git Beginner Resources](https://github.com/servetier/awesome-git-beginner-resources) and [my personal site](https://www.servetier.com)

### Socials
[![Twitter Link](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/servetier?style=social)](https://twitter.com/servetier/)

### To-do List
- [ ] Finish Coding Website Theme
- [ ] Add More Resources to the Awesome Git Beginners List
